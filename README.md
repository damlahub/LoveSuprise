# 🎉 LoveSuprise
This is a fun and simple web project I created for my fiancé’s birthday.  
At first glance, it's a romantic and sweet birthday message... until a surprise *horror twist* appears at the end! 👻

## ✨ Features

- Personalized text: Names, messages, and media can be customized.
- Video and image support.
- Light and funny code structure.
- Built for quick edits and reuse.

## 🛠️ How It Works

All editable content is stored in a customizable object:

```javascript
const customizedTexts = {
  title: `❤️ First Name & Second Name ❤️`,
  image: `assets/images/loveImage.jpg`,
  description: `Doğum günün kutlu olsun nice mutlu bizli senelere❤️`,
  clip: `assets/videos/video.mp4`
}
```
Just change the values to your desired names, image, message, and video!

📁 Files

- index.html — The main structure of the site.

- style.css — Basic styling.

- personalize.js — Customizable content logic.

- assets/ — Folder for images and video.

💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to go beyond the usual gifts and create something personal and a bit playful using code. It was a fun way to mix emotion, surprise, and creativity through development.
